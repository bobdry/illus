    <h1>About el Bob</h1>
    <hr class="order-hr">
    <p>Wolverine #1 came out in 1988. I was 11. We were moving from Greensboro to Lumberton and my mom needed something to keep me entertained on the trips back and forth. John Buscema&rsquo;s art did a really good job.</p>
    <p class="mt-4">I started reading comics and drawing for real way back then. Went to design school, worked for a printer, an ad agency, two universities, a bank and some tech companies. All the while, I kept on drawing.</p>
    <p class="mt-4">I&rsquo;ve drawn for The Izaak Walton League, Nature&rsquo;s Delight,Â Campbell Magazine, Corona and Modelo Beers, and a few others. My style is expressive and dreamy. I start with blue lines, then inks and then analog and/or digital colors. My client pitch, take a different approach &ndash; let one of my illustrations capture people&rsquo;s attention.</p>
    <p class="mt-4">Inspiration comes from the people in my life &ndash; how we get along and how we don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m a kid of the 80&rsquo;s so cartoons, comics, and movies had me dreaming big long before the age of the Internet. When I wake up in the morning I like a tall cup of coffee and a seat at the drafting table. Mind and hand, let the drawing flow.</p>
