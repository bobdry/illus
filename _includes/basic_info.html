<p>My illustration style combines the sincerity of hand drawing with the vibrancy of digital color application. I offer clients original art that will mesmerize their audience.</p>  
<h2><span>AS FOR</span> INSPIRATION</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m inspired by our species &mdash; how we get along and how we don&rsquo;t. Being a kid of the 80&rsquo;s, cartoons, comics and movies had me dreaming big well before everything went digital. Ideally, in the mornings, I'll take my coffee black and a seat at the drafting table. Mind and hand, let the drawing flow.
